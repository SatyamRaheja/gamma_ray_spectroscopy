# gamma_ray_spectroscopy
The aim is to prepare a prerequisite understanding about the tools and techniques used in Gamma Ray Spectroscopy. Important modules like pre-amplifier, pulse shaping amplifier
(CR-RC), Noise Analysis, Constant Fraction Discriminator (CFD) and Analog to digital convertor (ADC) will be explored using Python
programming.
