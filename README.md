# gamma_ray_spectroscopy
The prime objective of this project is to explore the various tools and techniques used in Gamma Ray spectroscopy by visualizing it through programming (Python). It will cover small introduction about radiations, production of Gamma Rays, various ways in which it interacts (detection mechanism), basics of signal processing and analyzing the energy spectrum. Important modules like pre-amplifier, pulse shaping amplifier (CR-RC), Constant Fraction Discriminator (CFD), Noise reduction through fast fourier transform (FFT) and Analog to digital convertor (ADC) will be explored using Python programming. The prime objective of this project is to prepare a prerequisite understanding about Gamma Ray Spectroscopy which will be accessible to everyone. The detectors and different modules used in the following study are very costly and thus may not be accessible for all the students. In the world of online facilities, this step of visualization through programming languages will have a greater reach and thus will be useful to provide better understanding to a beginner
